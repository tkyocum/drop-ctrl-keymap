# drop-ctrl-keymap
My DROP CTRL keymapping layout.

It's basically default, but with a few key mappings:

* Print screen toggles RGB modes (all, underlighting, edge lighting, off)
* Pause sends `Left Shift-OS-4`, the keyboard shortcut I have for taking a selection screenshot
* Tapping left shift will insert `(`, tapping right shift will insert `)` while keeping standard shift behavior intact
